## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation
This project documentation contains all relevant information for the upcoming project "IoT MIDI Controller". In addition to the requirements, the contact details of all team members can be found as well as the goals for providers and users. Additionally, the project is delineated in terms of content. Furthermore, the various framework conditions can be taken from this document. For this purpose, there is a schedule, an overview of the various risks and a corresponding quality assurance.
A MIDI controller is an electronic musical instrument that can be connected to other devices via MIDI interfaces. It allows you to control various music programs and synthesizers. The use of MIDI controllers is widespread in music production. In this project, a MIDI controller will be created using an Arduino board. For this, both the technical requirements and the objective must be precisely defined.

### 1.2 Target
The goal of the project is to create a functional MIDI controller that can be programmed independently with an Arduino board. In the successful implementation, the MIDI controller should have various buttons and knobs that can send note values and control commands to other devices via MIDI signals. Programming shall be done with a suitable Arduino development environment so that the MIDI controller can be flexibly adapted to different requirements. The MIDI controller shall be easy and intuitive to use and shall allow the user to produce his own music. Furthermore, the MIDI controller should be able to be controlled remotely via a web application. The MIDI signals of the controller are sent to the end user via USB, Bluetooth or optionally via WLAN.
The project is to be implemented as part of the module M.1.6 Methods of Knowledge Processing in the summer semester 2023. Through the successful implementation of the project, insightful learning in the context of knowledge processing is to be developed through the programming of software and hardware.
